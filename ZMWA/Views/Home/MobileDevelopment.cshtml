             Mobile application development is a term used to denote the act or process by which application
             software is developed for mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, enterprise digital
             assistants or mobile phones. These applications can be pre-installed on phones during manufacturing
             platforms, or delivered as web applications using server-side or client-side processing (e.g., JavaScript)
             to provide an "application-like" experience within a Web browser. Application software developers
             also must consider a long array of screen sizes, hardware specifications, and configurations because
             of intense competition in mobile software and changes within each of the platforms.Mobile app
             development has been steadily growing, in revenues and jobs created. A 2013 analyst report estimates
             there are 529,000 direct app economy jobs within the EU 28 members, 60% of which are mobile app developers.

                As part of the development process, mobile user interface (UI) design is also an essential in the
             creation of mobile apps. Mobile UI considers constraints, contexts, screen, input, and mobility as
             outlines for design. The user is often the focus of interaction with their device, and the interface
             entails components of both hardware and software. User input allows for the users to manipulate a 
            system, and device's output allows the system to indicate the effects of the users' manipulation.
             Mobile UI design constraints include limited attention and form factors, such as a mobile device's
             screen size for a user's hand(s). Mobile UI contexts signal cues from user activity, such as location
             and scheduling that can be shown from user interactions within a mobile application. Overall, mobile
             UI design's goal is mainly for an understandable, user-friendly interface. The UI of mobile apps
             should: consider users' limited attention, minimize keystrokes, and be task-oriented with a minimum
             set of functions. This functionality is supported by mobile enterprise application platforms or
             integrated development environments (IDEs).
