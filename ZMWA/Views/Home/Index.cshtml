                    <p>
                        A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.”
                        ― Albert Einstein

                        “You do not have to be good.
                        You do not have to walk on your knees
                        for a hundred miles through the desert, repenting.
                        You only have to let the soft animal of your body
                        love what it loves.
                        Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.
                        Meanwhile the world goes on.
                        Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain
                        are moving across the landscapes,
                        over the prairies and the deep trees,
                        the mountains and the rivers.
                        Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,
                        are heading home again.
                        Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,
                        the world offers itself to your imagination,
                        calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting –
                        over and over announcing your place
                        in the family of things.”
